        This trick pulls in Roslyn analyzers, its configuration, and other configuration we apply such as nullability
        checks to the C# project just for IDEs/OmniSharp, without making Unity do so.

        Because the nuget.config in this folder does not specify an installation path, these analyzers and their
        dependencies are installed separately in your global NuGet cache folder and are independent of what is used
        by Unity.

        (We can't use NuGetDependencies/Unity/NuGetDependencies.csproj directly because this project will then restore
        that project, which will look at the nuget.config next to it, and overwrite packages inside the Unity package
        folder in Assets/Packages/Unity.)
